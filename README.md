# Azure Digital Twin Ontology Samples

This repository contains the result of running MSFT's [RdfToDtdlConverter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/rdftodtdlconverter/digital-twins-model-conversion-samples/) sample against several existing DT-relevant ontologies (IFC, bot, brick). The goal is to better understand the current state of DTDL-RDF interoperability and look for ways to narrow the gap.
